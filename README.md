## Disclaimer

1. To keep programs simple and focused on OpenMP concepts, I am not doing extensive error checking. Also, the approach I am using in this tutorial might not be the optimal approach.
2. I have used AI (autocomplete feature) to help me write the comments (code descriptions and concept explanations) whenever it was correct.
